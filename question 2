Usage of this data could arise as an ethical by collecting and using student data. Students filling out the form might not be aware that their data is being used for business purposes. Additionally, if the form is linked to their Foodx account their information could be connected to them. Additionally, Foodx using the data can leave out other students. There are plentiful biology major entries, so it is easy to find what their most common order is; however, with only 3 civil engineering majors, food x could not target this demographic because there is not enough data. This would leave out civil engineering majors as a result.

A possible business factor to consider is not enough data. Possibly only a certain demographic of students participated in the promotion and it does not reflect the preferences of the overall student body. This could result in Foodx incorrectly targeting a demographic of students when there are other better options.  Food should try to increase their data especially for majors and schools with few entries.

Some technical Implications to think about is the scaling of FoodXâ€™s data. Can FoodX store and collect more data? Can the tool handle the data? How is FoodX storing the data and ensuring that it is secure?

All of these factors FoodX should consider when using the data from the promotion.
